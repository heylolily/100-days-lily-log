## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - Started 7/30/2023

### Day 1: July 30 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time figuring out what GitHub is and setting up my 100 days of coding challenge log. I tried to brainstorm how I wanted to go about this challenge and looked at how some other people went about the challenge. I started The Odin Project to suppliment my coding journey. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling really anxious about starting this journey and doubting whether or not I can fully commit to it, or even commit to a week. But besides that, I'm feeling motivated to put myself in tougher situations and push myself outside of my confort zone to learn more things and progress my journey.


### Day 2: July 31 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Tried some new practice problems with Javascript on CodinGame. Some of the questions were super hard where I didn't even know what it was asking (but I tried my best) but it was a nice way to try and push my brain to its limits to try and solve a short problem in under 15 mins. I did a problem about printing a domino with a top and bottom number. I was hoping to make a more efficient code, but I did what I could within the 15 mins I was given.

**Thoughts:** It's definitely a bit tiring to try and figure out problems within 15 mins, but it was a great way to try and keep myself focused on a problem for a short amount of time, plus it's formatted in a game-like way to keep me engaged and having some fun. It was also fun to try and solve a specific problem. At the end, sometimes people will share their code as well so it was nice to learn from others and see what kind of code they would come up with in 15 mins or less.

### Day 3: August 1st Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied outside since the weather was nice. I did some practice problems with js again. I still feel kind of lost on more complex problems, but loops are getting slightly easier to understand. I completed a problem of finding the diff between the sum of even and odd position numbers (looking at the index of the numbers, not the value itself). I brainstormed some ideas I wanted to have for a big project. Something I can work on occasionally that would be like my endgame project. I want it to be something I know I probably won't be able to do with my current knowledge, but something that will keep me motivated while I figure it out. I still want to do some smaller projects here and there to suppliment it though. I started the introduction of The Odin Project as well.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty motivated and happy with my code. I haven't done a lot of project work, but knowing that understanding js and how to problem solve with it is really nice. I feel like I'm slowly building up that momentum and motivation I losted earlier.

### Day 4: August 2nd Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm starting my first project today (kind of). I'm following a tutorial on how to make a pomodoro clock. It's super basic at the moment, but I want to try adding my own elements to it once I'm closer to setting it all up. I just did some of the html and css parts today. I hope to add js soon, but I have the file ready to link when I get there.

**Thoughts:** Felt a little down since I planned to try and do the project a bit more freely without following the tutorial as much, but I ended up basically going step by step with it. But nonetheless, I was able to fiddle with the components and get a feel for what each element does. It was a good refresh and made me remember that html and css can be fun and interesting to experiment with.

**Link to work:** Not sure how to link my work when I did it on VSCode. Maybe I'll figure out how to link stuff in the future.

### Day 5: August 3rd Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on my pomodoro timer. I fixed the css since it looked a bit off. My circle wasn't a perfect circle so I had to see where my issue was. I also started to work on the js portion as well. Setting up the countdown was a bit tricky but following the tutorial and looking up what functions were and what each part did helped me understand why I was typing something a certain way.

**Thoughts:** I was a bit intruiged and excited I guess since it was my first time actually implementing js with html in my own project. 


### Day 6: August 4th Friday

**Today's Progress**: Played a bit more with the js portion of my project. This was I was really able to try and pick apart each function and line. I also tried to add a bit of my own style to it. I wanted to make it so that when the timer goes off, it plays a bell sound as well as shows a little popup window.

**Thoughts:** Was a bit frustrating at first because I couldn't get the bell and alert to go off at the same time, even after trying multiple lines of code, but I was able to get somewhere close to the results I wanted. I didn't wanna dwell on it too long because I know I'd get more frustrated and want to quit. 


### Day 7: August 5th Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I actually didn't code today because I woke up late and then was out all day.

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 8: August 6th Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I didn't get to work on my timer since I wasn't working on my desktop but I just researched some ideas to add to my clock (like a reset button or pause buttons). Hoping to understand some of the code and then let myself think about it in the background, then implement it later today once I get on my pc or tomorrow. In the meantime, I just worked on the odin project for a bit.

**Thoughts:** Proud of myself for completing a project (for the most part, just adding my own elements and twists to it). Hopefully, I find more motivation to try another project, along with adding on to the pomodoro project.


### Day 9: August 7th Monday

**Today's Progress**: Honestly I don't remember what I did but I do remember practicing code for an hour, but I haven't gone around to updating the log on time every day. I think I tried to do a bit of the odin project but im stuck on trying to set up the program, so I did some practice problems with js.


### Day 10: August 8th Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my pomodoro timer, and was able to fully finish the start and features. It counts down smoothly and notifies you the way I want it to. I also added my own colors into it.

**Thoughts:** Feeling proud that I was able to implement my own project with html, css, and js. I hope to add on to the project a bit more, as well as start new projects too.


### Day 11: August 9th Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I added another feature to my timer! I added a reset button, which will reset the timer to 25 mins when you press the button. I was able to do it without really copying or taking note from other solutions online either. I looked at the work I already head, made some assumptions, tried them out, and it worked!

**Thoughts:** Feeling super proud that I tried to do something independently. I do like looking at what other people come up with and thinking of what their thought process would be, but it's different when you try and figure things out on your own.


### Day 12: August 10th Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Tried to figure out a way to add a toggle button for light/dark mode. I was sort of able to figure it out. I got the button working and I know for sure it switches, but I'm not sure how to make it so the whole page changes color. I target the body and it works fine, but when I try to target the html itself (since that's where the background css is) it doesn't work.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a little bit more sure about how things are going. Trying to implement js with html is getting a bit more natural to me once I'm able to really read and think about the code.


### Day 13: August 11th Friday

**Today's Progress:** Started a new project so I don't linger on the timer project for too long. I decided to go for a disscord bot. This one is less html/css and basically just all js. Using a site called repit and learned how to connect discord to it. I added it to my server and got it set up, but since I used an old tutorial and Discord has been updated, I'm gonna need to dig around and find newer solutions.

**Thoughts:** Excited to try out a discord bot. I've always wanted to try and implement my coding knowledge to something I like to use in my daily life. It's not like something "useful" but I know I'll find a lot of enjoyment out of it and I'm sure my friends would like it too.

### Day 14: June 26 Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Worked on displaying the results of API requests to TwitchTV

**Thoughts:** Progress on this feels slow, but it's fun to construct how exactly the response should be displayed.

### Day 15: June 27 Monday

**Today's Progress:** Worked on appending the results to the page in the right way using jQuery. Understood that I should refresh my jQuery knowledge to be more effective in this project. I will do that on the subway by watching CodeSchool videos on jQuery. Then, at home, I will just work on the project some more.

**Thoughts:** I am enjoying this, though I am always surprised how far my expectations of what the DOM results will be like actually end up looking when I reload the page.

### Day 16: June 28 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I've gone through some jQuery refreshers during the day, and was able to detect past errors of working with the DOM incorrectly. This led to me being able to receive the data and display it in a nice way on the page, approaching the functionality of the example app. Design still needs a lot of work, and I am considering adding some more functionality to the app. Also looking at Jekyll for some personal site projects.

**Thoughts:** Happy with my progress today.

### Day 17: June 29 Wednesday
Improved design, added online/offline channel indication, made channel status display properly.

### Day 18: June 30 Thursday
Implemented filtering all/online/offline, added a bit of animation to make it look nicer. Looking forward to improving the design - colors, font, etc.

### Day 19: July 1 Friday
Added search functionality to the TwitchTV app, also improved design a bit. Waited too long to start coding, so had to work between 3-4 am. However, I am happy that I still was able to continue with the challenge without missing a day.

### Day 20: July 2 Saturday
Improved layout and design, refactored code, now the results are sorted with online channels showing first in the list. Today I have started coding earlier than yesterday, and I am pretty happy with my progress. I only wish that I find more time to code per day so that I can improve quicker.

### Day 21: July 3 Sunday
Worked on layout and DOM manipulation using jQuery, trying to untangle the knot I've created for building blocks for each loaded channel. Didn't have much success with it, but that's ok. Tomorrow is another day. Also, I've done a lot of work today on filming and editing the video on 100 Days Of Code  and that took a lot of time. However, it was a much more interesting experience than I thought 😃

### Day 22: July 4 Monday
Improved design, spent a lot of time trying to fix CSS issues, had to refactor a lot of CSS code that was overriding some rules that needed to be active. Spent a bit of time on DOM manipulation with jQuery. I was very tired after yesterday - had just 4 hours of sleep or so, so it was difficult to make myself code today, but I am glad I did.

### Day 23: July 5 Tuesday
Fixed some layout issues, looked into flexbox problems, tried to figure out the way to make "spacebar" key not affect that input text, and also worked on adding the new channel to results on top. Today I was in a good mood, and not upset even though I haven't made big progress today. After French class today, I am glad that I still found the time to code. Even though I want to finish editing the videos for the channel, I had to postpone that and coded instead.

### Day 24: July 6 Wednesday
Worked on fixing the search/add channel functionality of the app. Also spent some time fixing the input behaviour - when it loses focus, the text inside is removed. I've come home late today and also had to work on editing the videos for the challenge, so I am glad that I have found the energy to code after.

### Day 25: July 7 Thursday
Read jQuery documentation for different methods of DOM manipulation and traversing. Made some changes to the way HTML is generated for the results. I have also gone through some challenges from CodeSchool's Try jQuery course during the day.

### Day 26: July 8 Friday
Fixed some CSS bugs, added initial version of error feedback on channel search. Fixed a problem with jQuery DOM manipulation where it was not creating a link for the channel block info. I'm glad to have finally solved some of these problems - they took a lot of time previously.

### Day 27: July 9 Saturday
Spent a lot of time fixing a bug with the input on adding channel. It wasn't reading the input. In the end of the coding session, I've fixed it. Very happy that I got at least one thing done with coding today, up until the last 10 minutes I couldn't figure out - I thought that the problem was connected with the way I was calling the element from the DOM, but turned out the value of the input was being set to an empty string even before it was read and used by the function - so it always was at 0. Worked a bit on displaying feedback when adding channels that don't exist.

### Day 28: July 10 Sunday
Worked on a different color scheme and on showing the feedback at the right time. Also spent time debugging the structure that adds the channels that exist and doesn't add the channels that don't - still in progress. Not happy with my progress today, I feel I could've done more on a Sunday.

### Day 29: July 11 Monday
Improved design, fixed bugs with adding a channel. Added the ability to add channels that don't exist to the results, displaying the question mark as their channel thumbnail. I am content with today's session, but looking to code more during this week. I would love to code for more than an hour a day, but to aim at 2 hours per day. I know I have the time for this on most days, I just succumb to this habit of postponing coding till very late at night. Will work on changing that. Reading "Ego is The Enemy" by Ryan Holiday and enjoying it a lot, drawing useful lessons from it.

### Day 30: July 12 Tuesday
It's always hard to code on a day when we have a French class (for 3 hours after work). I am glad I have found the time to code today, but I am not happy with my progress. I've worked on CSS of the TwitchTV project - debugging and improving it. The colors are better now, but it is still not a final version. Also had some issues with storage on my macbook - almost 90% of it is taken by "other" files, which I thought were iPhone backups, but I was wrong. Not sure what exactly the problem is. Had to move some photos to Dropbox to clean at least enough space to allow browsers, and coding editor to work.

### Day 31: July 13 Wednesday
Worked on improving the functionality of the list with displayed results, fixed CSS, getting the app ready for submission. Almost there. I thought I would be able to finish it today, but there is one more CSS issue left to fix, and also I want to make some improvements to the code itself. It was pretty frustrating at times to deal with CSS issues, but overall I am happy with my progress today. What I found helps me focus is listening to music with no lyrics and to music that is familiar to me. I've noticed an improvement in my focus over the last couple of days, where I was listening to comedy. Changed colour scheme.

### Day 32: July 14 Thursday
Worked on CSS issues that were left. Clean the code from comments and unnecessary parts. Uploaded the project to Github and to Codepen. I am glad to have finished the app, though it is not perfect, I am glad it is done. Next up is Tic Tac Toe.

### Day 33: July 15 Friday
Started coding very late at night, talked with my best friend - programmer about programming languages, and our app idea, that we are starting to build. I've set everything up for the Tic Tac Toe project, including SCSS, gulp, .gitignore and such, and it was much easier and faster than the previous time. It's a great feeling to start a new project, though I don't have a clear idea on how to implement the functionality in the best way yet.

### Day 34: July 16 Saturday
I've worked on the Tic-Tac-Toe app today, created a very simple grid, and started planning out the app logic structure. Today I've also been inspired by someone who came to a FreeCodeCamp meeting and talked about Open Source, and how useful and important it is. So I've decided to try to contribute to Open Source for the first time. I've chosen FreeCodeCamp, because it is beginner-friendly, and because it's something that I use constantly. I've gone through the explanations on how to create a local repo on my machine, how to do tests, how to go about making changes and making a pull request. It seems like I've managed to do it - just a simple text change for now, but is still good. Hopefully, they accept my pull request: https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/9757

### Day 35: July 17 Sunday
Spent time working on the basics of the Tic Tac Toe game - displaying the option of what symbol to choose, and then working with event listeners to add "clickability" to the grid. Now, after you choose a symbol, when you click on the grid, that symbol will be displayed.

### Day 36: July 18 Monday
Connected the state data structure with the DOM, and created a possibility for a computer to move. I've also added the first move that computer makes automatically for now. I am content with my progress today, though I hope I can do more in the following days!

### Day 37: July 19 Tuesday
Worked on automating the computer moves, turned out to be a bit more challenging that I thought! Will continue tomorrow. Today I feel tired, because we had French classes after work, and only got home close to midnight.

### Day 38: July 20 Wednesday
I've had an idea today on how to redo my personal website. I've created the first version today, but I have many more ideas on how to improve it - super excited to be working on this, and didn't notice the time at all today.

### Day 39: July 21 Thursday
Today I've worked on the personal site again. I've started implementing some of the planned interactivity, and that will probably involve a lot of structural changes to the site in general. I am excited to be working on this project, as I know it will be a good test of my skills, while also being extremely enjoyable! I don't notice the time!
