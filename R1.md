## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - Started 7/30/2023

### Day 1: July 30 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time figuring out what GitHub is and setting up my 100 days of coding challenge log. I tried to brainstorm how I wanted to go about this challenge and looked at how some other people went about the challenge. I started The Odin Project to suppliment my coding journey. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling really anxious about starting this journey and doubting whether or not I can fully commit to it, or even commit to a week. But besides that, I'm feeling motivated to put myself in tougher situations and push myself outside of my confort zone to learn more things and progress my journey.


### Day 2: July 31 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Tried some new practice problems with Javascript on CodinGame. Some of the questions were super hard where I didn't even know what it was asking (but I tried my best) but it was a nice way to try and push my brain to its limits to try and solve a short problem in under 15 mins. I did a problem about printing a domino with a top and bottom number. I was hoping to make a more efficient code, but I did what I could within the 15 mins I was given.

**Thoughts:** It's definitely a bit tiring to try and figure out problems within 15 mins, but it was a great way to try and keep myself focused on a problem for a short amount of time, plus it's formatted in a game-like way to keep me engaged and having some fun. It was also fun to try and solve a specific problem. At the end, sometimes people will share their code as well so it was nice to learn from others and see what kind of code they would come up with in 15 mins or less.

### Day 3: August 1st Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied outside since the weather was nice. I did some practice problems with js again. I still feel kind of lost on more complex problems, but loops are getting slightly easier to understand. I completed a problem of finding the diff between the sum of even and odd position numbers (looking at the index of the numbers, not the value itself). I brainstormed some ideas I wanted to have for a big project. Something I can work on occasionally that would be like my endgame project. I want it to be something I know I probably won't be able to do with my current knowledge, but something that will keep me motivated while I figure it out. I still want to do some smaller projects here and there to suppliment it though. I started the introduction of The Odin Project as well.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty motivated and happy with my code. I haven't done a lot of project work, but knowing that understanding js and how to problem solve with it is really nice. I feel like I'm slowly building up that momentum and motivation I losted earlier.

**Link to work:** Diff of sum of evens and odds js: https://github.com/heylolily/100-days-lily-log/assets/106398102/f78447d8-85ff-43a5-aefc-33b68c1b7d51


### Day 4: August 2nd Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I'm starting my first project today (kind of). I'm following a tutorial on how to make a pomodoro clock. It's super basic at the moment, but I want to try adding my own elements to it once I'm closer to setting it all up. I just did some of the html and css parts today. I hope to add js soon, but I have the file ready to link when I get there.

**Thoughts:** Felt a little down since I planned to try and do the project a bit more freely without following the tutorial as much, but I ended up basically going step by step with it. But nonetheless, I was able to fiddle with the components and get a feel for what each element does. It was a good refresh and made me remember that html and css can be fun and interesting to experiment with.

**Link to work:** Not sure how to link my work when I did it on VSCode. Maybe I'll figure out how to link stuff in the future.

### Day 5: August 3rd Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on my pomodoro timer. I fixed the css since it looked a bit off. My circle wasn't a perfect circle so I had to see where my issue was. I also started to work on the js portion as well. Setting up the countdown was a bit tricky but following the tutorial and looking up what functions were and what each part did helped me understand why I was typing something a certain way.

**Thoughts:** I was a bit intruiged and excited I guess since it was my first time actually implementing js with html in my own project. 


### Day 6: August 4th Friday

**Today's Progress**: Played a bit more with the js portion of my project. This was I was really able to try and pick apart each function and line. I also tried to add a bit of my own style to it. I wanted to make it so that when the timer goes off, it plays a bell sound as well as shows a little popup window.

**Thoughts:** Was a bit frustrating at first because I couldn't get the bell and alert to go off at the same time, even after trying multiple lines of code, but I was able to get somewhere close to the results I wanted. I didn't wanna dwell on it too long because I know I'd get more frustrated and want to quit. 


### Day 7: August 5th Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I actually didn't code today because I woke up late and then was out all day.

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 8: August 6th Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I didn't get to work on my timer since I wasn't working on my desktop but I just researched some ideas to add to my clock (like a reset button or pause buttons). Hoping to understand some of the code and then let myself think about it in the background, then implement it later today once I get on my pc or tomorrow. In the meantime, I just worked on the odin project for a bit.

**Thoughts:** Proud of myself for completing a project (for the most part, just adding my own elements and twists to it). Hopefully, I find more motivation to try another project, along with adding on to the pomodoro project.


### Day 9: August 7th Monday

**Today's Progress**: Honestly I don't remember what I did but I do remember practicing code for an hour, but I haven't gone around to updating the log on time every day. I think I tried to do a bit of the odin project but im stuck on trying to set up the program, so I did some practice problems with js.


### Day 10: August 8th Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my pomodoro timer, and was able to fully finish the start and features. It counts down smoothly and notifies you the way I want it to. I also added my own colors into it.

**Thoughts:** Feeling proud that I was able to implement my own project with html, css, and js. I hope to add on to the project a bit more, as well as start new projects too.


### Day 11: August 9th Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I added another feature to my timer! I added a reset button, which will reset the timer to 25 mins when you press the button. I was able to do it without really copying or taking note from other solutions online either. I looked at the work I already head, made some assumptions, tried them out, and it worked!

**Thoughts:** Feeling super proud that I tried to do something independently. I do like looking at what other people come up with and thinking of what their thought process would be, but it's different when you try and figure things out on your own.


### Day 12: August 10th Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Tried to figure out a way to add a toggle button for light/dark mode. I was sort of able to figure it out. I got the button working and I know for sure it switches, but I'm not sure how to make it so the whole page changes color. I target the body and it works fine, but when I try to target the html itself (since that's where the background css is) it doesn't work.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a little bit more sure about how things are going. Trying to implement js with html is getting a bit more natural to me once I'm able to really read and think about the code.


### Day 13: August 11th Friday

**Today's Progress:** Started a new project so I don't linger on the timer project for too long. I decided to go for a disscord bot. This one is less html/css and basically just all js. Using a site called repit and learned how to connect discord to it. I added it to my server and got it set up, but since I used an old tutorial and Discord has been updated, I'm gonna need to dig around and find newer solutions.

**Thoughts:** Excited to try out a discord bot. I've always wanted to try and implement my coding knowledge to something I like to use in my daily life. It's not like something "useful" but I know I'll find a lot of enjoyment out of it and I'm sure my friends would like it too.

**Link to work:** [Personal Site - kallaway.io](https://github.com/Kallaway/kallaway.github.io/commit/e6cbe92ec39af252f78f7741e6afebce8e867f47)

### Day 14: August 12th Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my discord bot. It's just a simple duck bot that honks when you enter a slash command honk. We used to have a duck bot that honked in the past but the bot got disabled so I'm happy I was able to make something like that. I was struggling at first because it kept throwing an error back, but I was able to figure it out. Apparently, the error meant that the file I was directing the code to wasn't a folder, but a js file. Since my code was expecting to sift thru multiple folders, it didn't work. 

**Thoughts:** Super frustrated at first ebcause no matter what I was doing, it didn't work, but after taking a break, I was able to let it marinate and figured it out. I'm super proud of how much improvement I can see with these projects and consistency day by day. Feeling super proud of myself.


### Day 15: August 13th Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I tried to figure out a way to have the discord bot run continuously even when I close the coding program or turn off my pc (since its all local). I was able to figure out a way to sort of figure it out. I had to upload another file with js to "keep it alive" by creating an http server for it. It's only temporary though because it works for a bit, but once there's an hour of inactivity, it'll shut down.

**Thoughts:** A little dizzy with all this new code but I've been managing. I feel like I'll be able to figure out a way to have the bot run 24/7 without me running it continuously. I hope that once I can figure it out, I can add more features to the bot. I want it to be a fun bot that ppl can use for anything.


### Day 16: August 14th Monday

**Today's Progress:** Studied outside so I didn't work too much on my bot. It's really hard for me to handle all the material on my small laptop screen. I just did some practice problems with js which I was able to finish relatively quickly. Freshened up on the js projects in freeCodeCamp as well.

**Thoughts:** Happy with my progress today.


### Day 17: August 15th Tuesday
**Today's Progress:** Tried a cloud server to ping my bot every hour so it stays alive 24/7. I can't really do much to test it out so I'll have to check in later. In the meantime, I did osme more practice problems and brainstormed where to go from here. I want to start another project but not sure where to start.

**Thoughts:** Wasn't feeling too happy about studying today. I felt really apathetic and lethargic. Motivation was really low and I was just having one of those days:/

### Day 18: August 16th Wednesday
**Today's Progress:** Did some practice problems for js again. I also double checked my duckie bot to see if the live server worked. I had to make some adjustments to it but it seems to be working for sure now! Super proud of myself. It's basically done now, but maybe in the future, I can add some additional features for fun.

### Day 19: August 17th Thursday
**Today's Progress:** Did some practice problems and reviewed some js material. I went through the subjects of js on w3schools. There were some things that wasn't fully covered in fcc so it was good to review. I learned a little but more about scripts and how to add them to html and use different things to target html and change stuff dynamically. 

### Day 20: August 18th Friday
**Today's Progress:** Continued to work on the fcc modules. This time, I learned a bit about jQueries and Bootstrap. After that, I decided to make a boilerplate for my next project. Not sure what it's gonna be. I want to try and implement the jQuery and bootstrap material I learn as well.

### Day 21: August 20th Sunday
**Today's Progress:** Continued freecodecamp front end libraries section

### Day 22: August 21st Monday
**Today's Progress:** Struggled with studying today. I was trying to think of a new project to do but I ultimately scrapped it. I decided maybe doing something interactive like a game using hmtl/css/js would be fun. There's a link that shows a bunch of beginner projects so I might try to do some of those. 

### Day 23: August 22nd Tuesday
**Today's Progress:** Started a weather app today. I'm following a tutorial by a youtube programming asmr channel. I got the html and css part down. I might want to add stuff and edit things later, but I just have the template down. I'll work on the js part another time since that's usually the hard part. Breaking it down makes it easier to process each component. 
**Thoughts:** I feel like my learning has been plateauing...I feel like I'm just going through the motions of tutorials and not really retaining as much as I'd like. I mean I'm reading the code and typing it out and connecting the dots, but I feel like it's not as meaningful as I'd like it to be. I'll probably try making another mini project on the side as I do the weather app. That way I can try to implement the stuff on my own more. Overall feeling a little lost and unmotivated.

### Day 24: August 23rd Wednesday
**Today's Progress:** I finished the weather app by linking it with js. I feel like I should add my own elements to it. I think I want to add a button that allows you to switch between F and C for the temperature and mph and km/h for wind speed. That way it'll be good practice.

### Day 25: August 24th Thursday
**Today's Progress:** I started working a little bit on the unit conversion for my weather app. I also started a template for my next project that I kind of want to try doing on my own. I'll try making a simple calculator for basic algebra problems. I feel like it might but a really easy but challenging project. Since most of it is just buttons and math problems, but I'll have to figure out how to make those calculations work one button at a time.

### Day 26: August 27th Sunday
Missed a couple days, so I'll have to make it up by adding those to the end of the 100 days log.
**Today's Progress:** I worked a bit more on the calculator project I started. Most of it has been just working on the css to design the calculator to look like a real calculator. Once I get that don, I'll work on the js.

### Day 27: August 28th Monday
**Today's Progress:** Worked on my calculator as usual. I realize how hard it is to deisng your own project without the tutorials, but it's def refreshing in a sense that I have to work on something from scratch, and think about each line of code myself. It's tough, but it definitely is nice to push myself past my limits.

### Day 28: August 29th Tuesday
**Today's Progress:** I'm really starting to struggle with the calculator. I might have to start over again. I was hoping to get started on the js soon, but I'm still having trouble setting up the html and css on it's own, it's starting to get clouded in my mind, it might just be easier to start from the bottom up again. I'm thinking of brainstorming what I want on paper first and taking notes like that before I actually get to work, which might help a lot more.

### Day 29: August 30th Wednesday
**Today's Progress:** Worked more on the calculator. In the end, I'm using another tutorial alongside it because the js was just not jsing for me :( I hope that I can still make sense of everything and I'll have to make notes line by line to make up for it so it feels more meaningful (to me at least). Hoping that implementing js becomes easier in the future:/

### Day 30: August 31st Thursday
**Today's Progress:** Finished up the rest of my js for the calculator, but the only issue is it doesn't seem to be working with the html. When I click the buttons on my html page, it doesn't do anything...

### Day 31: September 1st Friday
**Today's Progress:** This whole calculator thing is hurting my brain....I've doublechecked my html css and js and can't seem to get it to work.

### Day 32: September 3rd Sunday
**Today's Progress:** I even redid my html and css to see if it made a difference (it didnt). Its really frustrating cuz I feel like I've basically followed the tutorial line by line and nothing is working. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the function that initializes the buttons but it's not doing anything no matter how I try to edit it. Its really really frustrating but I'll have to either figure out a way for it to work, or find a different way for it to work.

### Day 33: September 5th Tuesday
**Today's Progress:** I redid the entire html/css/js for the calculator and realized that there's just somethign wrong with the js itself, and I wasn't actually doing anything incorrect by following the tutorial. I'll figure out a way to finish this calculator app, either trying to figure out a different way to go about the code, or trying a different tutorial. I saw one earlier that used classes in order to make the calculator, which peaked my interest so I could potentially try that project. I tried not to let this fail set me back so I plan to try a new project while I plan how I want to go about the calculator. Also did some practice problems today to refresh some js.

### Day 34: July 16 Saturday
I've worked on the Tic-Tac-Toe app today, created a very simple grid, and started planning out the app logic structure. Today I've also been inspired by someone who came to a FreeCodeCamp meeting and talked about Open Source, and how useful and important it is. So I've decided to try to contribute to Open Source for the first time. I've chosen FreeCodeCamp, because it is beginner-friendly, and because it's something that I use constantly. I've gone through the explanations on how to create a local repo on my machine, how to do tests, how to go about making changes and making a pull request. It seems like I've managed to do it - just a simple text change for now, but is still good. Hopefully, they accept my pull request: https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/9757

### Day 35: July 17 Sunday
Spent time working on the basics of the Tic Tac Toe game - displaying the option of what symbol to choose, and then working with event listeners to add "clickability" to the grid. Now, after you choose a symbol, when you click on the grid, that symbol will be displayed.

### Day 36: July 18 Monday
Connected the state data structure with the DOM, and created a possibility for a computer to move. I've also added the first move that computer makes automatically for now. I am content with my progress today, though I hope I can do more in the following days!

### Day 37: July 19 Tuesday
Worked on automating the computer moves, turned out to be a bit more challenging that I thought! Will continue tomorrow. Today I feel tired, because we had French classes after work, and only got home close to midnight.

### Day 38: July 20 Wednesday
I've had an idea today on how to redo my personal website. I've created the first version today, but I have many more ideas on how to improve it - super excited to be working on this, and didn't notice the time at all today.

### Day 39: July 21 Thursday
Today I've worked on the personal site again. I've started implementing some of the planned interactivity, and that will probably involve a lot of structural changes to the site in general. I am excited to be working on this project, as I know it will be a good test of my skills, while also being extremely enjoyable! I don't notice the time!
